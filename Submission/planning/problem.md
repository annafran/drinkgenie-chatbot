# Order your ideal drink chatbot

## Problem statement

Create a chatbot that helps the user decide which drink to order at a restaurant. Use the provided decision tree to build the chatbot.

The chatbot program needs to ask the user their name at the beginning, so that the responses will be personalised. The chatbot will ask the user about a specific preference related to drinking, and the user will answer one of two options. The user's answer will trigger the chatbot program to ask another question, based on the users previous answer. The user will continue to answer the questions, responding with a string. The chatbot will finally provide the user with the drink type that they should order. 

The chatbot will recognise if the user doesn't enter one of the required answers at each stage, letting them know that they need to try and enter their answer correctly again.
